I find this video important because many of the characters originally relied on misogynistic or stereotypical tropes in the video game. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hML-FGHGEN4\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>I hope that if you end up watching this video, you enjoy it!</p>\n<p>Cheers, </p>\n<p>Saige</p>\n<p> </p>",

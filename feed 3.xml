                <p>Hello, there! </p>
<p>You have just stepped into the digital realm of Saige's Website. Right now, there is not much to see, but here, you <em>can</em> learn more about me and my upcoming project. </p>

<p>Since this is a course on digital storytelling, and a digital humanities project, I thought that I would share one of my favorite youtube video essays, about the Netflix series <em>Arcane</em>. </p>
<hr>
<p>This video discusses how women from the video game League of Legends are brilliantly written in the series to portray honest depictions of diverse female characters. I find this video important because many of the characters originally relied on misogynistic or stereotypical tropes in the video game. </p>

<p>I hope that if you end up watching this video, you enjoy it!</p>
<p>Cheers, </p>
